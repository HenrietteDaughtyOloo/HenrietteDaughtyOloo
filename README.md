 As a software developer with a strong background in both Android and web development, I have been able to create and collaborate on different impactful projects. 
 ⚡ I believe in the ability to maximize the availability of essential resources to the general population through digital platforms.
#
 One of my recent achievements is a project for creating a gamified Kotlin application to enhance citizen engagement and understanding of governance principles as per the constitution of Kenya, and hence they can contribute meaningfully from a knowledgeable perspective. The application also has chatbot functionality to enable users to prompt questions they are curious about concerning the Constitution and getting answers according to the Constitution. 

#
 Currently open to new opportunities and collaborating in new/open-source projects.

<!--###  I enjoy exploring new concepts and am currently diving into Flutter for cross-platform projects.-->
