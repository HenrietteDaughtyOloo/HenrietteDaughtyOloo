## ðŸŒ± As a software developer with a strong background in both Android and web development, I have been able to create and collaborate on different impactful projects. 
## âš¡ I believe in the ability to maximize the availability of essential resources to the general population through digital platforms.
## ðŸ”­ One of my recent achievements is a project for creating a gamified application to enhance citizen engagement and understanding of governance principles in Kenya, and hence they can contribute meaningfully from a knowledgeable perspective. The application also has chatbot functionality to enable users to prompt questions they are curious about concerning the Constitution and getting answers according to the Constitution. 

## ðŸ˜„ I enjoy exploring new concepts and am currently diving into Flutter for cross-platform projects.
